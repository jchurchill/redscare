===== Example derivations from the data model =====
===================================================

Games that the current user is a part of
  Game.joins(:players).where(players: { player: current_user })

Who owns an individual role within any game
  game.players.find_by!(role: Role.merlin)

Game's current round in progress
  game.rounds.order(:round_number).last!

Number of passed / failed rounds
  game.rounds.select({ |r| r.outcome == RoundOutcome.passed }).count # passed
  game.rounds.select({ |r| r.outcome == RoundOutcome.failed }).count # failed

===================================
===== Notes about concurrency =====
===================================
There will be some cases where an update can only happen if certain conditions are met. As an example,
consider starting the game: in order to correctly start the game, a number of players equal to the size of
the game must have joined. However, players can freely join / rejoin during this phase, so the player count is changing.

A race condition could arise with the code that might exist to handle these operations:

# (1) Add a player
game.players.create(player: current_user)

# (2) Remove a player
game.players.find_by(player: current_user).destroy

# (3) Start a game
if game.player_count == game.players.count
  game.begin() # assigns roles, sets state to in-progress
end

Suppose the room is full and the leader decides to start the game, and at the same time a player chooses to leave the room.
Suppose these actions end up getting interleaved like this:
- if-statement in (3) - evaluates to true
- player removal in (2)
- game.begin in (3)

The game is now in an invalid state.

This conflict can be generalized to anything that you might call a "non-final submission". By choosing to make operations irrevocable, we can avoid this in most cases.

Avoid issue by requiring finality:
- Nomination selection process (once a person is nominated for a mission, it cannot be changed)
- Submitting upvote / downvote in nomination voting (once a vote is cast for a nomination, it cannot be changed)
- Submitting pass / fail in mission voting (once a pass/fail is cast for a mission, it cannot be changed)

After thinking through it, it looks like the only operation that's essential to have be non-final is game joining / leaving.
We can handle the concurrency issue of transitioning to the next state with code that locks on the game record like the following:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#pessimistic-locking

# ** When starting a game **
Game.transaction do
  game = Game.lock.find(<game_id>)
  if game.player_count == game.players.count
    game.state = GameState.rounds_in_progress
    game.save!
  end
end
# If state now RoundsInProgress, continue with game.begin()


# ** When adding a player **
Game.transaction do
  game = Game.lock.find(<game_id>)
  has_player = game.players.any?(player: current_user)
  has_available_spot = game.player_count > game.players.count
  if !has_player and has_available_spot
    game.players.create({ player: current_user })
    game.players.save!
  end
end


# ** When removing a player **
Game.transaction do
  game = Game.lock.find(<game_id>)
  has_player = game.players.any?(player: current_user)
  game_started = game.state != GameState.created
  if has_player and !game_started
    game.players.find_by(player: current_user).destroy
    game.players.save!
  end
end
